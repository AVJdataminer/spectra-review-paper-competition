## Why

If you work on cutting edge Machine Learning and AI like we do at Mathpix, then you know how difficult it can be to navigate the flood of new research papers published every month. It is also difficult to assess the real world practicality of papers published on Arxiv. As many ML practitioners know, just because an approach shows some a small improvement on a benchmark dataset, does not actually mean that approach is superior in practice.  

Unfortunately, the people with nuanced understanding of state-of-the-art ML research don’t typically have much incentive to break down the pros/cons of cutting edge approaches. Such people usually have their hands full with research and development. The result is that most ML summary work is done by altruistic bloggers. Shouldn’t this work be compensated given how valuable it can be? 

For this reason we are announcing the Mathpix Prize for Research Exposition (MPX) as a way of launching of our upcoming publishing platform, Spectra, where ML researchers and practitioners can make money from writing great ML review content for practitioners.

Spectra is our upcoming online publication for crowdsourced research reviews. It is not only a place where ML content can be published, shared, and monetized, but also a great place for those who want to read and learn from great content written by the best people in their field. Spectra will be a web-first publication, which means no more reading research in PDF form! 

## Competition Rules

The rules of the competition are as follows:

- Deadline for submission: March 3rd, 2021.
- The research discussed in the review paper need not be new/original research
- The review paper, however must be original writing and in English
- The goal of the paper should be to summarize/explain cutting edge approaches in a particular subfield of ML, for example machine translation, text summarization, and image segmentation
- Papers must be submitted via PR to this public Github repo

Papers must be submitted as .md (Markdown) or .mmd (Mathpix Markdown) format (TODO: add link to blog article explaining MMD).  Links to external code and repos are acceptable and even encouraged, but the writing should stand on its own.  

## Prize 

The prizes will be determined by the following criteria:

- depth 
- accuracy
- clarity of writing
- good coverage of the most important literature on a given topic
